# osu! skins

This is my personal set of osu! skins, which is bound to expand over time.

All of them are probably going to be heavily mixed. Just for my own reference, I'll be including where the elements came from.

## The skins

### Megumin

#### Standard

Good all-round skin. Colorful, but not noisy.

The colors could probably use some tweaking, as some of them are less distinct than others, some are way too bright, etc.

#### Traceable

Mostly a gimmick skin in SD, but if you're playing traceable, it's absolutely necessary IMO.

The approach circle could probably use some size-tuning, as its current size is just arbitrarily good enough for me.

The only real things it changes are the approach circle and hiding a bunch of stuff you couldn't see in TC anyway so that the skin doesn't look absolutely derpy in SD. This actually makes SD look very similar to TC, which I assume would work in stable. This does, however, make hidden impossible with this version of the skin. 

#### Original

The source skin that I modified over time. It's just here for my own reference, as I believe the changes I made were good enough that there'd be no reason for me to go back.

## How to read the changelogs

### Titles

At the top is always the skin title. On derivative skins, the title of the source skin it changes is included below the title,

Below the title(s) are the actual changelogs of the versions.

### Version Descriptors

The version descriptor(s) are included in <these>.

Version descriptors follow this guide:

Each version descriptor is a word of predetermined type.

Versions start at A and advance towards Z.

The first version descriptor advances upon major stylistic and functional changes.

The second version descriptor advances upon small stylistic and functional changes, or a group of miscellaneous changes.

The first version descriptor must be an adjective.

The second version descriptor must be a verb.

Once a word is used for a version descriptor, it cannot be used again within the same branch of skins. ie. Atomic cannot be used again within the Megumin skin branch, but could be used in, say, a 02 skin branch.

### Symbols

Before a change or comment there will be a single symbol followed by a space.
